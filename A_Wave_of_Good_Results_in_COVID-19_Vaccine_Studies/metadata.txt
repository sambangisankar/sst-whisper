audio_1|researchers are reporting progress in the race to develop as safe and effective vaccine against the new Coronavirus
audio_2|the disease it causes covid-19 has killed at least six hundred ten thousand people worldwide
audio_3|more than 14.7 million people have been infected
audio_4|two different experimental vaccines have produced strong immune reactions in people involved in the study
audio_5|and neither produced serious unwanted effect
audio_6|the separate research was published Monday in the British medical journal the Lancet
audio_7|the most promising of the two preventative medicines comes from a partnership between Oxford University in Britain and drugmaker AstraZeneca
audio_8|the company has signed agreements with many government to supply its vaccine if it proves to be effective and winds legal approval
audio_9|AstraZeneca has promised to make 2 billion vaccine treatment
audio_10|the New York Times newspaper reports that the vaccine has been given to more than 10,000 Volunteers in Britain Brazil and South Africa
audio_11|it says 30,000 people in the United States are to receive the experimental vaccine next week
audio_12|the drug company can Sino biologics Incorporated and the Chinese military is developing the other vaccine
audio_13|it was tested on 508 healthy volunteers
audio_14|who received one treatment
audio_15|the researchers report
audio_16|most of those tested showed a good immune reaction
audio_17|about 77% of the volunteers reported temporary side effects
audio_18|including increased body temperature and pain at the place of injection
audio_19|none of the side effects were severe or unusual
audio_20|the researchers report
audio_21|the AstraZeneca and can sign out vaccines use a harmless adenovirus
audio_22|to carry genetic material from the new coronavirus into the body
audio_23|overall the results of both trials are broadly similar and promising
audio_24|now we're barsys and William Moss wrote in the Lancet
audio_25|Riders aren't vaccine experts at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
audio_26|in Baltimore Maryland
audio_27|also Monday the drugmaker Pfizer and its partner bio and Tack
audio_28|reported success on their vaccine candidate
audio_29|that study was small involving 60 healthy adult
audio_30|outside experts have not yet examined the research finding
audio_31|last week the medical research company moderna announced strong immune reaction in tests of a vaccine developed by researchers at the US National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases
audio_32|however the volunteers involved in that research reported more unwanted effects
audio_33|such as tiredness
audio_34|add paint chills and muscle pain
audio_35|dr. Peter hotez is an infectious diseases expert at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston Texas
audio_36|on Monday he told the American newsgroup CNN that the first vaccines may not be our best vaccine
audio_37|hotez said it would probably take another year to produce all the necessary evidence that the new coronavirus vaccines are safe and effective
audio_38|early Tuesday European leaders agreed on a 2.1 trillion-dollar budget
audio_39|the agreement includes
